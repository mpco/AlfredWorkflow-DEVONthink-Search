## Configuration

### `ignoredDbUuidList`: ignore databases

`dnt` and `dnm` search in **all** opened databases. You can ignore some databases by setting `ignoredDbUuidList` environment variable in Alfred workflow.

1. Copy database link in DEVONthink, which is similar to `x-devonthink-item://1FC1A542-D8CA-4807-B806-8617966870B5`.
2. The part `1FC1A542-D8CA-4807-B806-8617966870B5` is the database's UUID.
3. Fill in workflow configuration with UUIDs. You should separate multiple UUIDs with comma(,).

### `filterOutGroup`: filter out group and tag in searching result

You can set environment variable `filterOutGroup` to `yes` if you want to filter out group and tag.

### Automation permission in macOS Mojave

Alfred will ask for Automation permission to control DEVONthink when you run the workflow for the first time. You should check up permission of Alfred controlling DEVONthink in `System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Automation` if the workflow doesn't work.
